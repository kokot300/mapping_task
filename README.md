# mapping_task
simple mapping from API to model script


mapping_task is a short script (*script.py*) to download articles and their media from https://mapping-test.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com/, map them to pydantic models (from *models.py*) and finally print them on the screen. It took me few hours during the weekend to write it.

To install it, just make sure you've got all dependencies installed from requirements.txt and just run script.py from console like: `$ python ./script.py`
